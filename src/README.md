## 🧠 Overview

This project contains implementations of **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns that can have **generic abstractions**.  
It provides reusable, extensible examples of how to apply these patterns in modern .NET development.

The following GoF Design Pattern categories are included:

---

### 🏗️ [Creational](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns)

> Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Factory Method
- Singleton

---

### 🧱 [Structural](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns)

> Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite

---

### 🔁 [Behavioral](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/behavioral-patterns)

> Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Strategy
- Visitor
